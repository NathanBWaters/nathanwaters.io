CHANGELOG
===========

## 2.0.0 ( [see diff](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/compare/v0.1.2...v2.0.0) )

### Core
- Should work with React 15 :sparkles:
  - This version should work with [`react@^15.0.0`](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/04/08/react-v15.0.1.html)
  - For `react@^0.14.7`, please install `react-three-renderer@^0`
  - This is because React is increasing separation between its core and `react-dom`, therefore
  the tricks used to make `react-three-renderer` needed to change as well.
- Lots of the core has been rewritten to stay in sync with React 15
  but that means there will probably be new bugs appearing.
- Convert to a proper version system
- Upgrade other npm packages

## 0.1.2 ( [see diff](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/compare/v0.1.1...v0.1.2) )

### Components
- Add `<sprite/>` component ( #39 )
- Add `uniforms` property to [&lt;shaderMaterial&gt;](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/wiki/shaderMaterial) and [&lt;rawShaderMaterial&gt;](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/wiki/rawShaderMaterial) ( #36 ).
- Allow reordering of components within the `<resources>` component ( #40 )

### Documentation
- Improve [&lt;module&gt;](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer/wiki/module) documentation ( Thanks @DelvarWorld )
- Improve commenting for materialDescriptorBase

## 0.1.1

### Fixes
- core
  - Fixed a bug which would crash when the return type from a composite component would change e.g.:
  ```jsx
  class Wrapper extends React.Component {
    static propTypes = {
      internal: React.PropTypes.bool,
      res: React.PropTypes.bool,
    };

    render() {
      if (this.props.internal) {
        return (<scene/>);
      }

      if (this.props.res) {
        return (<MyResources/>);
      }

      return (<MyScene/>);
    }
  }
  ```
